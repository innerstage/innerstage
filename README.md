# Hey there :wave:
Hi, I'm Mauricio! I'm a self-taught Python developer with over 6 years of experience and I'm very interested in the Rust programming language. I've worked as a Data Engineering Manager & Training Specialist for the past 4 years. I'm looking for new job opportunities and I'm constantly learning more about technology and computational social science in the meantime.

### Tech Skills
* 🐍 *Python* (6+ years interaction): *pip*, *poetry*, *pandas*, *NumPy*, *flake8*, among others.
* 🌶 *Flask* (2+ months), 🤠 *Django* (2+ months), ⚡️ *FastAPI* (6+ months).
* 💿 *PostgreSQL* (4+ years), 🟨 *ClickHouse* (4+ years).
* 🍃 *MongoDB* (6+ months), ፨ *Neo4j* (6+ months), 🟥 *Redis* (6+ months).
* 🦀 *Rust* (6+ months).
* 🌐 *HTML*, 🔽 *Markdown*, 📃 *LáTex* (When needed).

### Academic Background
- I hold a B.Sc in Civil Industrial Engineering from Universidad de Concepción, the whole program is six years long in Chile: You get your bachelor's degree at the end of year four, and then you take specialization courses, internships and write a undergraduate dissertation over the last two years. I specialized in mathematical optimization, mixed-integer optimization, heuristics, exact methods, agent-based algorithms, machine learning and their applications to vehicle routing problems, production planning and other industrial issues.

- I started working immediately after school, but I managed to complete an online MicroMaster's program in Statistics & Data Science from MIT provided through EdX in my free time over the course of 2 years, finishing in 2020. This program consisted of four courses plus a Capstone Exam at the end: "Probability", "Data Analysis in Social Science", "Fundamentals of Statistics" and "Machine Learning with Python".

- I'm currently enrolled in Harvard's Professional Certificate in Web Programming, I'm still working on a project to finish the first course, "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science", and then I'll move to the specialization course "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript".

- I'm also enrolled in UC Davis' Computational Social Science Specialization, an exciting new field that I want to know more about. I already completed the first course "Computational Social Science Methods", and I have three more to go in addition to the Capstone Project: "Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Ethics", "Social Network Analysis" and "Computer Simulations".
