# Hey there :wave:

I'm Mauricio! I hold a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and completed the MITx Micromasters program in Statistics and Data Science from EdX (2020). I'm a Python developer with 7 years of experience and worked as a Data Engineer for the past 4 years.

On my last job I managed ETL repositories and activities across the company, using Python, *pandas* and Datawheel’s own library *bamboo-etl* for ETL automatization as technologies. These ETL pipelines created OLAP cubes and APIs to provide the front-end developers with the data necessary to design the visualizations for different public and private projects.

Right now I'm looking for new job opportunities in the Data Engineering field, specially using Python.

### Academic Background

*You can click on any of the following to know more about the respective program:*

<details>
<summary>B.Sc. in Civil Industrial Engineering, Universidad de Concepción (Concepción, Chile).</summary>
<br>
I hold a B.Sc in Civil Industrial Engineering from Universidad de Concepción, the whole program is six years long in Chile: You get your bachelor's degree at the end of year four, and then you take specialization courses, internships and write a undergraduate dissertation over the last two years. I specialized in mathematical optimization, mixed-integer optimization, heuristics, exact methods, agent-based algorithms, machine learning and their applications to vehicle routing problems, production planning and other industrial issues.

<details>
<summary>MicroMasters Program in Statistics & Data Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA).</summary>
<br>
I started working immediately after school, but I managed to complete an online MicroMaster's program in Statistics & Data Science from MIT provided through EdX in my free time over the course of 2 years, finishing in 2020. This program consisted of four courses plus a Capstone Exam at the end: "Probability", "Data Analysis in Social Science", "Fundamentals of Statistics" and "Machine Learning with Python".

<details>
<summary>Professional Certificate in Web Programming, Harvard University (Cambridge, MA)</summary>
<br>
I'm currently enrolled in Harvard's Professional Certificate in Web Programming, I'm still working on a project to finish the first course, "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science", and then I'll move to the specialization course "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript".

<details>
<summary>Computational Social Science Specialization, University of California (Davis, CA).</summary>
<br>
I'm also enrolled in UC Davis' Computational Social Science Specialization, an exciting new field that I want to know more about. I already completed the first course "Computational Social Science Methods", and I have three more to go in addition to the Capstone Project: "Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Ethics", "Social Network Analysis" and "Computer Simulations".
